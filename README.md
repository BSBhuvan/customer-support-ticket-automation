# Customer-support-automation-of-Ticket-creation

Hi, Iâ€™m Bhuvan from Presidency University. This project is a team effort by a group of four students, where we worked together to build a web application for automating customer support ticket creation.

### ðŸ’¡ Project Goal
The goal is to streamline customer support by enabling users to submit issues easily, which are automatically categorized and logged into a ticket management system.

### ðŸ”§ Key Features
- A simple UI for users to submit support requests
- Backend logic for ticket classification and logging
- Database integration to track ticket statuses and history

This was a collaborative effort covering frontend, backend, and database components â€” each of us contributing to the full-stack development.
